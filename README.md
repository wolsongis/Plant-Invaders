# Plant Invaders: Alachua County 

## Project Description 
This project is part of my GIS Programming course, in Spring 2025, and serves as my midterm project. 
This app provides an interactiv interface that allows the users to report invasive plant sightings, visualize the invasive data, and contribute to a shared database. 
It is a full stack web app built with Esri.js intended for both mobile and esktop use.
